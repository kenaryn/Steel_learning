## Learning and growing

I am following through the Scheme programming language (online edition) book by R. Kent Dybvig to learn Steel Scheme.
It was published after the 4th edition.

### Goal

I intend to learn in a advanced way the Steel dialect of Scheme.

I learn functional paradigm and symbolic programming in the process to become a better programmer, as Javascript is my
current main driver.

### Unrolling

On my free time, alongside my current vocational training focused on web development.

1. I read the lesson in the chapter.
2. I evaluate the object evaluated from an expression (from memory or on paper if possible).
3. I write out the said expressions and fix it until successfully compiling.
4. I refactorize when possible.
5. I compare my results with those of the book author.
6. Repeat and persevere.
